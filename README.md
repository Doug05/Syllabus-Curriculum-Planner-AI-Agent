# Syllabus-Curriculum-Planner-AI-Agent
An AI-powered chatbot developed using **IBM watsonx Assistant** to assist educators, students, and academic institutions in planning structured syllabi and curriculum outlines for courses across various subjects.

# Syllabus and Curriculum Planner AI Agent

This project is an AI-powered syllabus and curriculum planner built using IBM watsonx technologies. It helps educators and students organize course topics efficiently over a specified duration.

## Project Structure

- `syllabus_planner.py` — Python script demonstrating syllabus planning logic using sample data.
- `datasets/sample_curriculum.json` — Sample curriculum data file in JSON format.
- `.gitignore` — Specifies files to ignore in the repo.
- `LICENSE` — Project license file.

## How the Python Code Works

The `syllabus_planner.py` script demonstrates how the curriculum planner AI agent works using sample data.

- It loads the curriculum data from `datasets/sample_curriculum.json`.
- It plans a syllabus by assigning topics to each week for a specified duration.
- The planned syllabus is printed to the console week by week.

This script serves as a simple, runnable example showing how you can build or extend an AI syllabus and curriculum planner using the provided data.

### Running the Script

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine. Then, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python syllabus_planner.py
