# Syllabus-Curriculum-Planner-AI-Agent
An AI-powered chatbot developed using **IBM watsonx Assistant** to assist educators, students, and academic institutions in planning structured syllabi and curriculum outlines for courses across various subjects.

# Syllabus and Curriculum Planner AI Agent

This project is an AI-powered syllabus and curriculum planner built using IBM watsonx technologies. It helps educators and students organize course topics efficiently over a specified duration.

## üß† Problem Statement
Syllabus and Curriculum Design Optimizer

A Syllabus and Curriculum Design Optimizer is an AI system designed to assist faculty in developing and refining academic course content. It can autonomously:

- Analyze existing syllabi  
- Recommend improvements  
- Align topics with learning outcomes and accreditation standards  

Using natural language processing (NLP), the system understands curriculum goals and can suggest:

- Relevant topics and instructional materials  
- Assessments and activities  
- Supporting academic or industry-aligned resources  

The agent can:

- Generate draft syllabi  
- Update course structures  
- Recommend instructional strategies based on current academic and industry trends  

‚ú® Syllabus Optimizers enhance the quality, consistency, and innovation in curriculum development across academic programs.

## üîç Key Capabilities

- üìö Design structured week-by-week curriculum plans  
- ‚úçÔ∏è Customize course topics, objectives, and activities  
- ü§ñ Uses AI/NLP for interpreting and organizing curriculum elements  
- üß† Maps topics to outcomes and standards  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Python-based implementation with modular logic  
- üìÑ Works with editable JSON-based curriculum templates  
- üí° Suggests improvements to existing course structures  
- üì¶ Export-ready for integration into academic tools or LMS

## Tech Stack

- Python 3  
- JSON for curriculum data structure  
- IBM watsonx Assistant (optional or planned integration) 

## Project Structure

## How the Python Code Works

The `syllabus_planner.py` script demonstrates how the curriculum planner AI agent works using sample data.

- It loads the curriculum data from `datasets/sample_curriculum.json`.
- It plans a syllabus by assigning topics to each week for a specified duration.
- The planned syllabus is printed to the console week by week.

This script serves as a simple, runnable example showing how you can build or extend an AI syllabus and curriculum planner using the provided data.

### Running the Script

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine. Then, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python syllabus_planner.py
```
